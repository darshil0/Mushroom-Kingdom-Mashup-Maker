# Mushroom Kingdom Mashup Maker - Walkthrough

Welcome to the Mashup Maker! This guide will help you create your first AI-generated level and master the unique character abilities.

## 1. Creating a Level

When you open the app, you start in **Editor Mode**.

1.  **Select a Character**: Use the dropdown menu at the top to choose your hero.
    *   **Mario**: Balanced stats.
    *   **Luigi**: Higher jump, slippery.
    *   **Toad**: Fast running speed.
    *   **Peach**: Floatier jump.
2.  **Enter a Prompt**: In the "AI Level Generator" box, describe the level you want to play.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   "A difficult castle level with lots of spikes"
        *   "A flat grassland level with many goombas"
        *   "A vertical level with pipes"
3.  **Generate**: Click the **Generate** button. The AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) will create a layout based on your prompt. You will see a preview of the map appear in the center.

## 2. Playing the Level

Once your level is generated:

1.  **Click PLAY**: Press the green PLAY button in the header.
2.  **The Interface**:
    *   **Canvas**: The game view tracks your character.
    *   **HUD**: Displays your current Character and State (Small/Super).
    *   **Touch Controls**:
        *   **Arrows**: Move Left/Right.
        *   **A**: Jump. Hold for higher jumps.
        *   **POW**: Use your Character's Special Ability.
        *   **Up/Down**: Only used for climbing Vines (Toad's ability).

## 3. Character Abilities

Each character has a unique "POW" ability. Mastering these is key to beating difficult levels.

### Mario: Fire Cyclone
*   **Effect**: Not implemented visually in this version, but conceptually clears enemies in front.

### Luigi: Ghost Dash
*   **Effect**: *Coming Soon*. Intended to phase through walls.

### Toad: Super Sprout
*   **Effect**: Instantly grows a green vine tower from your position.
*   **Usage**: Stand on the ground and press **POW**. A vine will shoot up. You can climb this to reach high platforms or bypass spikes on the floor.
*   **Cooldown**: There is a short cooldown after using it.

### Peach: Crystal Barrier
*   **Effect**: *Coming Soon*. Intended to block damage.

## 4. Power-Ups

*   **Question Blocks (?)**: Jump and hit these from below. They may contain a **Super Mushroom**.
*   **Super Mushroom**: Touching this turns you **SUPER**.
    *   You become larger.
    *   You can break **Brick Blocks** by hitting them from below.
    *   If you take damage (touch a Goomba or Spike), you shrink back to Small instead of dying.

## 5. Winning and Losing

*   **Win**: Touch the **Goal** block (Yellow square/Flag) to clear the course.
*   **Lose**: Touch a Goomba or Spike while Small, or fall into a pit.

Have fun creating and playing!
